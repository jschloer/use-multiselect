## Install

```bash
npm install --save use-multiselect
```

## Usage

useMultiSelect just manages the set of items that are currently selected. We try to be a little clever byonly keeping track of the items that are different from the default. This means it can in theory be used to manage a large list of objects that aren't necessarily fully known. So you could, for instance use select all on a lazy loaded list. Basic usage is shown below:

```tsx
import * as React from "react";

import { useMultiSelect } from "use-multiselect";

const Example = () => {
  const { isSelected, setSelected } = useMultiSelect();
  return (
    <div>
      {items.map(item => {
        return (
          <div>
            <label key={item}>
              {item}
              <input
                type="checkbox"
                item={item}
                checked={isSelected(item)}
                onChange={ev => toggleSelected(item, ev.target.checked)}
              />
            </label>
          </div>
        );
      })}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Functions

### function setSelected(key: string, value: boolean) => void

Takes a key and value and sets the item to the given value.

### function toggleSelected(key: string) => void

Takes a key and toggles the current selected value of that key

### function selectAll() => void

Marks all keys as selected.

### function deSelectAll() => void

Marks all keys as not selected.

### function isSelected(key: string) => boolean

Returns true or false based on whether the given item iscurrently selected

### function getAllSelectedKeys(keys: Array<string>) => Array<string>

Filters the given array of keys, returning just the selected ones.

### function getSelectionState() => {allSelected: boolean, exceptions: Array<string>}

Returns the internal selection state used by useMultiSelect. This can be used, for instance, to support multiSelect with lazy loaded items. The returned object has enough information to send elsewhere for processing of commands.
